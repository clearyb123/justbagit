                Terms and Conditions:

                TERMS AND CONDITIONS
                The following terms cover our relationship with you, the customer. We give you plenty of time to inform us of any delivery or other problems and in return we ask you to be aware of manufacturing tolerances and to order goods in plenty of time as we cannot be held responsible for costs due to delays in delivery. Note that ownership of goods is kept by JustBagIt until all monies due are paid (Reservation of Title). Orders are accepted subject to the conditions below unless specifically agreed in writing:
                <ol>
                    <li>Claims for non-delivery or damaged delivery must be received within 14 days of the order being placed.</li>
                    <li>JustBagIt shall not be responsible for delay or non-delivery caused by circumstances outside our control.</li>
                    <li>The goods delivered are subject to the normal trade tolerances, and that sizes are overall, cut to cut, and that quantities manufactured and delivered may vary up to 10% from the quantity ordered. Invoicing is on the basis of delivered quantity. We reserve the right to change the material used in the bags to maintain quality or manage shortfalls. </li>
                    <li>Bags are packed in suitable containers which may vary from time to time. Special packing arrangements can be made on request.</li>
                    <li>Unless expressly agreed in writing, JustBagIt does not give any warranty, whether express or implied, statutory or otherwise, that the product is suitable for packing any particular goods, produce, material or substance.
                    <li>Any claim for defective goods must be made within 1 month of invoicing.</li>
                    <li>The ownership of the goods will only be transferred to the customer when all that is owing to JustBagIt has been paid. Until the moment of full payment of what is owed to JustBagIt, the customer shall keep the objects in question for JustBagIt in their capacity of fiduciary owner. Nevertheless the customer will be entitled to sell these objects to a third party within the framework of the normal carrying on of their business and to deliver them on condition that if JustBagIt so requires, the customer as long as he shall not have fully discharged his debt to JustBagIt shall hand over to them the claims which he has against the buyer emanating from the transaction.</li>
                    <li>All prices and charges are exclusive of value added tax, if applicable</li>
                </ol>

            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <div class="aboutusText">
                <p>We are here to provide you with excellent, good value products and to earn your confidence. Your privacy is therefore of paramount importance to us, and we outline below how we will treat and respect your personal information and the steps we take to keep it secure.
                    <br><br>The data controller responsible in respect of information collected is Serman Consultancy Ltd, and we can be contacted at Kariba House, 43 Bankhall Lane, Hale, Cheshire WA150LF or mobile:  07788 996782 or email: mark@justbagit.co.uk


                <h3>What information do we collect?</h3>
                When you use our service to make an enquiry or order a product, we will need to collect personal information about you. This is kept to the absolute minimum in order to correctly and efficiently process your enquiry or order.
                We may collect and use the following kinds of personal information when you contact us, place an order, subscribe to a newsletter, register or enter information on our website: Name, title, email address, delivery and invoice postal addresses, telephone number, mobile telephone number, the reason for your contact and any product, contact or marketing preferences.
                This information will be collected primarily from you as information voluntarily provided to us, but we may also collect it where lawful to do so from publicly available sources, third party service providers, individuals whom you have indicated have agreed for you to provide their personal information, government or law enforcement agencies.
                We will also collect information on how you interact with our website or social networking pages and may include your IP address, geographical region and other traffic and communication data. If you create an online account we will collect and store securely your username and password and we also use cookies to collect data
                If you use your credit or debit card for payment we will need to share your data with a third party to enable this processing. We ensure that this is done securely and in accordance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. We do not store your payment card details. We would like to emphasise that we do *not* record the details that appear on your credit-card (e.g. credit card number, expiry date, CVV) on our systems. In fact we avoid coming into direct contact with this information altogether - instead this information is collected for processing only by trusted payment gateways, who authorise and process your payment for us. These organisations use state-of-the-art security to collect and protect your payment details so that we never even have to see them.

                <h3>How do we use this information?</h3>
